# Compare zoning plans by using GitHub, 3D-models, a browser (Edge), Three.js and CSS

When you can't implement a 3d-model in your website for any reason you can set a link which opens a tab to your 3d-project on GitHub-Pages (it's free) like **https://stewahn.github.io/CompareZoningPlans/**.

This project is super simple. And this is why it is super simple to provide modern digital apps in the field of city- and spatial-planning for generating participation, transparency and feedback. This repository is a template. Use it for your own purpose.

The original code is from three.js and you can find it here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js
In my case I build this project on top of this: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webgl_loader_collada.html
GitHub-Pages for styling your own site or app: https://pages.github.com/

Ahoj!
